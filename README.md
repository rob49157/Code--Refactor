# HTML:link not working properly  solution:
 On the HTML file, line 16 had a broken unclickable link. in order to fix it i had to go  to line 29 to add "ID" and remove the "CLASS" in order for it work

# HTML: 
On class "content" i created  an "inner-content" class in order to make css code smaller on line 74 thru 80.
 # CSS: On the Style.css file in order the shrink it I made a few changes.
 
 to start with i deleted ".header h1 seo' class because it was serving no purpose aside from using <span> seo. 

 on line 89 thru 102 of the original code starting with ".benefit-lead", ".benefit-brand",".benefit-cost" i deleted them and consolidateD them by calling the class "benefit" with "h3". it was simpler because they share "H3".

 on line  119  thru 135 of the original code i repeated the same as the previous point but called ".benefit  img" instead

 on line 164 thru 174 i repeated the same process as  previous two points, but this time called the ".content img"

 on line 176 thru 189 i repeated same steps as the previous lines. I called the class ".content h2" to consolidate the 3 elements into 1

# Web Response on CSS.
 in order to make the site responsive i had to got to the CSS file and adjust the " .header div ul" class to 20px.
